# Sort-Images-By-Face

A python script to catagorize a batch of image files by the faces in them.

## Features:
- Batch catagorize images by face.
- Batch catagorize images that have multiple faces in them.

### How to use:
- Get a good picture of each of the people you want to catagorize and put them in a folder (will not work if this picture has multiple faces in it).
- Rename the images to the name of the person in them (or any other name you like).
- Select that folder as the reference folder.
- Now select the folder with the files you want to catagorize.
- Wait for it to complete catagorizing.
